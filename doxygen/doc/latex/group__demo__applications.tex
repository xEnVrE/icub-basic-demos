The app directory stores directories which group sets of configuration files and scripts to run a certain group of modules together. Each one of them is what we call an application. In other words, an application is an instantiation of a set of modules that run at the same time.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The app directory stores directories which group sets of configuration files and scripts to run a certain group of modules together. Each one of them is what we call an application. In other words, an application is an instantiation of a set of modules that run at the same time. 

Documentation for each application goes in each directory.

Ideally these directories will contain only scripts and ini/txt files. Use src to store source code.
